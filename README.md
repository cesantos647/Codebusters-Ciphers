# Codebusters-Ciphers
Code Busters is an event in Division C for the 2019 Science Olympiad season. In this event, up to 3 participants must decode encrypted messages, or they may be required to encode messages with certain advanced ciphers. 

This tool is meant to be a hub of all the ciphers needed to suceed in this event. I created this tool in order to make ciphers for myself and to also create a tool for others to create their own ciphers and even check their answers. I hope to expand this tool to anybody looking to succeed in the 2018-2019 Science Olympiad season and to anybody creating tests for their students for cryptography
